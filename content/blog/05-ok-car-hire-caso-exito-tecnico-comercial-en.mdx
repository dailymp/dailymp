Summary: In under two months we delivered an enterprise car-rental platform that combines clean architecture, engineering excellence, high performance and AI acceleration, designed for large development houses and consultancies that demand quality, speed and scalability.

## 🏗️ Stack & key components 🔧
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript (strict)
- **Build / Dev:** Vite (HMR, tree-shaking, minification)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + PostCSS
- **Backend ERP:** Odoo 18 via JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Design:** Figma with hand-off and plugins (VSCode ↔ Figma sync)
- **Typed services & contracts:** `vehiclesService`, `categoriesService`, `helpdeskService` and DTOs in `odoo-contracts.ts`
- **Image optimization:** WebP / `OptimizedImage` (lazy, `srcset`, `decoding="async"`)
- **E2E tests:** Playwright with Page Object Model

## 🔌 Enterprise integration & architecture
Resilient JSON-RPC client handling authentication, errors and CRUD operations over Odoo models (`fleet.vehicle`, `vehicle.rental.agreement`, `vehicle.rental.category`, etc.). For a deeper technical write-up of the backend and delivery process, see: [From zero to production in 8 weeks — Building a vehicle rental system with AI co-pilots](https://medium.com/@oadiaz/from-zero-to-production-in-8-weeks-building-a-vehicle-rental-system-with-ai-co-pilots-be8a9dbbf7a7).

- Togglable mocks with `VITE_USE_MOCK` for offline development and fast iteration.
- Decoupled services and strict contracts for maintainability and scalability.

We also automated PR generation and documentation to keep the workflow reproducible.

## 🤖 AI as a strategic lever (new & highlighted)
AI agents and automations were used to:

- Generate base components and E2E test templates.
- Create realistic test data and mocks.
- Suggest refactors and code optimizations, and generate PRs/documentation automatically.

Result: significant reduction in implementation and review time without compromising technical quality.

## ⚡ Performance & code optimization (new & highlighted)
- Lazy loading of images and components to reduce initial bundle and improve LCP.
- Code-splitting & dynamic imports to load only what’s necessary per route.
- Tree-shaking and minification with Vite to remove dead code.
- Image optimization (WebP, `srcset`, conversions) and attributes `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"`.
- Caching & compression: Nginx configured with Gzip, `Cache-Control` and expirations for static assets.
- Additional practices: selective prefetching, dependency analysis and TTFB/TTI optimizations.

Impact: measurable improvements in load times, interactive experience and reduced hosting/bandwidth costs.

## 📱 Fully responsive and SEO-friendly (new & highlighted)
- Mobile-first: design and testing across breakpoints for consistent mobile, tablet and desktop experiences.
- SEO-friendly: semantic HTML, optimized meta tags (`title`/`description`), Open Graph and clean URLs; use of `preconnect`/`prefetch` to improve crawlability and perceived speed.

Combined with performance and accessibility, this improves indexing, CTR and conversion rates.

## 🧪 Quality & deployment
- Playwright E2E automates critical flows (forms, bookings, multi-step navigation).
- CI/CD friendly: Docker multi-stage builds (Node → Nginx) with healthchecks and security.
- Best practices: code reviews, integrated documentation and linters/TS to reduce technical debt.

## 💼 Business value for large dev shops and consultancies
- Rapid, repeatable delivery: complex MVPs on aggressive timelines thanks to AI + automation.
- Reduced risk: strict TypeScript and testing reduce regressions and operational costs.
- Enterprise scalability: ERP integrations and modular architecture ready for growth.
- Differentiation in proposals: pixel-perfect design with Figma + team sync, combined with high-performance engineering.

## ✅ Conclusion
OK Car Hire is an operational blueprint: robust architecture, high-quality standards, optimized performance, SEO and strategic use of AI agents that speed delivery and improve quality. It’s a replicable, scalable solution for enterprise projects seeking speed, maintainability and high business impact.
