OK Car Hire is a technical and commercial case study that demonstrates how disciplined engineering, AI-assisted automation, and performance-first practices enable delivering enterprise-grade products under tight timelines without sacrificing quality.

## Project summary
In under six weeks we shipped an enterprise car-rental platform aimed at large development houses and consultancies. The technical goals were straightforward: clean architecture, typed services, ERP integration (Odoo), and a high-performance user experience. Commercially, the product needed to be a repeatable blueprint for future projects.

## Stack & key components
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript (strict)
- **Build / Dev:** Vite (HMR, tree-shaking, minification)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + PostCSS
- **Backend ERP:** Odoo 18 via JSON-RPC 2.0
- **E2E tests:** Playwright with Page Object Model
- **Image optimization:** WebP, responsive srcset, lazy loading

### Typed services & contracts
We implemented decoupled services with TypeScript contracts — `vehiclesService`, `categoriesService`, `helpdeskService` — to work safely with Odoo models like `fleet.vehicle` and `vehicle.rental.agreement`. Example DTO:

```typescript
export type VehicleDTO = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  categoryId: number;
  plate?: string;
  active: boolean;
};

export interface VehiclesService {
  list(page?: number): Promise<VehicleDTO[]>;
  get(id: number): Promise<VehicleDTO>;
  create(payload: Partial<VehicleDTO>): Promise<VehicleDTO>;
}
```

Typing enabled automatic mock generation and reliable refactors.

## Enterprise integration & architecture
A resilient JSON-RPC client handles authentication, retries, and error normalization for CRUD operations against Odoo models. For faster offline development we used a `VITE_USE_MOCK` switch to enable realistic mocks and speed up iteration.

- Decoupled modules for testability and maintainability
- Strict contracts to reduce ambiguity and technical debt
- Robust logging and tracing for production debugging

We also automated PR generation and documentation to streamline handoffs.

## AI as a strategic accelerator
AI agents produced base components, E2E test templates, realistic test data and suggested refactors that became PRs. This practical use of AI resulted in:

- Faster generation of repetitive code
- Higher-quality test suites and test fixtures
- Reduced manual review time while preserving technical quality

The result: significantly shorter delivery and review cycles.

## Performance & code optimization
- Lazy load images and components to improve LCP
- Code-splitting and dynamic imports per route
- Tree-shaking and minification with Vite
- Automated WebP conversions and responsive `srcset`
- Nginx configured with Gzip and Cache-Control for static assets

The outcome was measurable improvements in LCP, TTFB, and lower hosting costs.

## Quality & deployment
Playwright E2E covers critical flows (booking, payments, multi-step navigation). The CI pipeline uses Docker multi-stage builds (Node → Nginx) and healthchecks to ensure safe production deployment.

## Business impact
Combined, AI acceleration, strict typing and robust testing deliver:

- Repeatable, fast MVP delivery
- Lower operational risks and costs
- Enterprise scalability and ERP connectivity
