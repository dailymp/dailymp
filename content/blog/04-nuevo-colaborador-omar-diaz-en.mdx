At DailyMP, we believe talent makes the difference. That's why we're excited to introduce our new team member: **Omar Antonio Díaz Peña**, an expert in AI-powered backend development who joins our team to take your projects to the next level.

## Who is Omar Díaz?

Omar is a professional with **over 10 years of experience** in enterprise software development. His expertise spans from complex cloud architectures to AI agent orchestration for development — a unique combination that dramatically accelerates delivery times without sacrificing quality.

### Areas of expertise

- **Odoo (v15-v19)**: Complete mastery of the most flexible ERP on the market
- **Cloud Architecture**: Design of scalable and resilient systems
- **AI Agent Orchestration**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and assisted development methodologies
- **Smart CI/CD**: Pipelines that learn and optimize automatically

## What Omar brings to the team

Omar's addition significantly strengthens our [AI-Driven Development](/en/servicios/ai-driven-development) offering. Here are the concrete benefits for our clients:

### 3-4x faster development

Omar has consistently demonstrated the ability to take projects that would traditionally take **6-9 months down to just 8 weeks**. How? By orchestrating specialized AI agents that work in parallel, write production-ready code, and generate tests while the team rests.

### Complete backend systems in weeks

We're not talking about incomplete prototypes or MVPs. We mean:

- Complex domain architecture (multi-currency, local taxes, workflows)
- Integration with OCA modules and battle-tested libraries
- Automatic documentation and maintainable code
- **219+ automated tests per project** as standard

### CI/CD that learns from your deploys

The pipelines Omar configures aren't static:

- **Predictive tests**: prioritized based on code changes
- **Build optimization**: smart caching that reduces times by 40-60%
- **Auto-rollback** with anomaly detection
- Reports that explain *why* it failed, not just *what* failed

## Real success story

A concrete example of Omar's impact: he developed a **complete vehicle management system** that included:

- 11 interconnected business models
- Automated recurring billing
- Local tax compliance
- Integration with external systems

**From zero to production in 8 weeks.** A timeline that would have been unthinkable with traditional methodologies.

## The process that defines his work

Omar follows a proven methodology that guarantees results:

1. **Discovery & Stack** — Analyzes your domain, chooses the optimal stack, and configures specialized AI agents
2. **Parallel Development** — While you review one module, the next is already in development
3. **Continuous Testing** — Every feature is born with tests. It's not optional
4. **Optimization & Handoff** — Delivers documented code and teams that know how to maintain it

## Predictive analysis and continuous optimization

One of the key differentiators Omar brings is his focus on **early problem detection**:

- AI analyzes code patterns to predict bugs before they occur
- Identifies bottlenecks before users experience them
- Suggests improvements with PRs ready to merge
- Assisted refactoring with full project context

## Why this matters for your project

The timeline you've been quoted is probably outdated. With Omar on the team, DailyMP can offer you:

- **Real speed**: Development that used to take months, now in weeks
- **Guaranteed quality**: Automated tests as standard, not optional
- **24/7 optimization**: Systems that continuously improve
- **Maintainable code**: Automatic documentation and clear architecture
